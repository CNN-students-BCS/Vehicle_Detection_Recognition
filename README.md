# Vehicle_Detection_Recognition
This is a Matlab lesson design for vehicle detection and recognition.  Using cifar-10Net to training a RCNN, and finetune AlexNet to classify. Thanks to Cars Dataset:http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html

#Software

Matlab R2016b

#Code 

You can use it to finish your task for single picture or video. Make sure your picture or video frame has 3 channels (colorful)
